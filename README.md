This repository holds my project for which I was asked to create a Q&A website similar to Stack Overflow.  
The website is called Highside and it is a motorcycle Q&A website which uses PHP and Javascript for the most part. 
The initial database information is in the SQL file provided. Bootstrap was used for styling. It was developed using [MAMP](https://www.mamp.info/en/). 
Below is a list of some of its features:
* Users ask and answer questions. The user who asked the question is allowed to pick the right answer which is marked green and moved to the top of the answer list
* Users can add tags to their questions which can then be searched for using the search box
* User profiles can be accessed to see a list of the questions they have asked and various details
* Users can upload profile pictures or use [Gravatar](http://en.gravatar.com/). The profile picture appears next to the user's name with every question and answer
